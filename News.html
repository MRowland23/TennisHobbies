  		<p>The hosts began Sunday's final day 2-1 up in the best-of-five tie, but David Goffin levelled for Belgium by beating Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 6-2.

		World number 18 Pouille claimed victory for his country with an emphatic 6-3 6-1 6-0 win over an opponent ranked 76th.</p>
 		<p>France's first title since 2001 was celebrated wildly by the 27,000 crowd at the Pierre Mauroy stadium in Lille.

		"When Jo lost I was crazy in my head and I was like 'go on, play your game, try to beat him'. This is a feeling from another world," Pouille said.</p>
  		<p>"There are no words needed, just look at the atmosphere and hear the emotion right now.

		"I am so proud of my team, we really wanted this trophy. After 16 years, we finally got it, I'm very happy."</p>
  		<p>France had reached three finals since their previous Davis Cup success - losing in 2002, 2010 and 2014.

		Captain Yannick Noah said victory was the conclusion of "a beautiful adventure".</p>

  <p>Spaniards Rafael Nadal and Garbine Muguruza were named as the International Tennis Federation world champions on Friday - the first time in 19 years the awards have gone to players from the same country.</p>
  <p>Nadal, who claimed the honour for the third time, made a sensational comeback from an injury-plagued 2016, winning a 10th French Open title and the U.S. Open to take his grand slam haul to 16, three behind Roger Federer who also won two of the year's majors after returning from injury.</p>
  <p>The 31-year-old Mallorcan ended the year as world number one, although he pulled out of the season-ending ATP Finals in London due to a knee injury.
  Muguruza won the ITF award for the first time after capturing the Wimbledon title and ascending to the world number one ranking for the first time.
  She ended the year ranked number two behind Romania's Simona Halep who is still chasing a first grand slam title.</p>
  <p>The last time two players from the same country scooped the awards was in 1998 when Americans Pete Sampras and Lindsay Davenport took the honours.
  Lukasz Kubot of Poland and Marcelo Melo of Brazil won the men's doubles award while Chan Yun-Jan of Chinese Taipei and the recently-retired Martina Hingis of Switzerland took the women's prize.</p>

  <p>Two years later he began competing and his potential was quickly recognised, although on reflection, Murray says, there are aspects of his development he would change.</p>
  <p>"I signed with a management company for the first time when I was 12, 13 years old, which to me is ridiculous," Murray admits. "It's way, way too young. You don't need that pressure.</p>
  <p>"You're trying to become a professional and certainly my parents were not experienced in dealing with those situations.</p>
  <p>"You can get yourself into trouble by signing long-term contracts that might not be in your best interests. Things like that you can avoid if you've got the right people around you."</p>
  <p>He added: "I am so happy for this group, when you don't win for 16 years there are a lot of things to take care of.
  
  "We were just trying to play like a team. Even though we have a number one with Jo, to have Lucas playing the final game at home and winning us the Davis Cup, it was so beautiful.</p>
  <p>"This is when his career is really going to start, he was fantastic."</p>

          <td><details><summary><h5>An Effective and Discreet Innovation</h5></summary>
  <p>From my experience, the shot clock is an effective and discreet innovation - which will allow the rules to be enforced more strictly and consistently.

The clock ticks down silently from 25 seconds, and you very quickly cease to notice it. And some discretion is still available to the umpires, who in Milan only began the countdown as they announced the score - and after the applause had died down.</p>
  <p>So a lung-bursting rally of 30 shots, which attracts wild applause, will allow players far longer than 25 seconds to recover.

The Grand Slam Board has also decided to enforce strictly the length of the warm-up from next year. But players will still have seven minutes before the first ball is struck from the time they walk on court, which can often feel interminable. After all, how long do you need to toss a coin?</p>
  <p>In another change for 2018, a player who is on site but unfit to play and withdraws before the start of the main draw will still receive 50% of the first-round prize money.

This became a priority for the All England Club after Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer both won by retirement on Centre Court in less than 45 minutes on the second day of this year's Wimbledon.</p>
  <p>The ATP decided at the start of this year to award injured players all their first-round prize money for withdrawing before the event.

With a first-round loser’s cheque worth £35,000 at Wimbledon, it remains to be seen whether the prospect of foregoing half of that amount will still prove a disincentive for some.</p>
  <p>In future, however, any player who is judged to have performed "below professional standards" could be fined all of the first-round money they have earned.

The final change proposed by the Grand Slam Board will have to wait until 2019 - but it is their intention to increase the jeopardy for the top seeds in the opening two rounds.</p>
  <p>Since 2001, 32 players have been seeded - which has often led to some predictable outcomes - but from 2019, there would be only 16 seeds.

And if the rankings remain as they are now, Nick Kyrgios, 2014 US Open runner-up Kei Nishikori and 2016 Wimbledon finalist Milos Raonic would all be potential first-round opponents for Federer and Nadal.</p>

  <p>"I am excited to join our forces and cannot wait to compete again having a new team to back me up"
  By Joe Shread</p>
  <p>Novak Djokovic has announced that Radek Stepanek will join his coaching team for the 2018 season.

  Stepanek, 39, announced his retirement from professional tennis just ten days ago following more than 20 years on the ATP World Tour.</p>
  <p>Djokovic employed Andre Agassi as his coach in May last year in what was the American's first move into coaching following a trophy-laden playing career.

  Agassi, an eight-time Grand Slam champion, will continue to coach Djokovic at the majors with 39-year-old Stepanek stepping in at other tournaments.</p>
  <p>Djokovic said: "Radek is one of my very close friends on the tour and I was always impressed with his level of determination, passion and love for the sport.

  "He has lot of experience and knowledge, and has played on a high level for many years. I am excited to join our forces and cannot wait to compete again having a new team to back me up."</p>
  <p>He added: "I am so happy for this group, when you don't win for 16 years there are a lot of things to take care of.
  
  "We were just trying to play like a team. Even though we have a number one with Jo, to have Lucas playing the final game at home and winning us the Davis Cup, it was so beautiful.</p>
